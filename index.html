        <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
          <br>Schizophrenia is a mental illness that affects a personâ€™s behaviour, thinking and emotions. 
          People that suffer from schizophrenia seem to have lost touch with reality (National Institute of 
          Mental Health, 2020). Symptoms of schizophrenia can include hallucinations, delusions, disordered 
          thinking and behaviour. You can imagine that this can heavily impair one's daily functioning. 
          <br>Luckily, there are treatments that manage the symptoms and solve the problems related to daily 
          functioning. However, the causes of schizophrenia are very complex and not yet fully understood. It is
          thought that there are several factors that contribute to the risk of developing schizophrenia, namely 
          genetic and environmental factors, for example, stressful surroundings. After intensive research, we
          found that genetically, schizophrenia is very similar to bipolar disorder - with a total of 14 
          dysregulated genes in common. 
          <br>Bipolar disorder, also, is a mental disorder that causes abnormal shifts in mood, energy level, 
          concentration and activity levels. People with bipolar disorder experience mood episodes, which are 
          distinct periods where the person alternates between feeling very high and upbeat and feeling very sad
          and down. Since bipolar disorder and schizophrenia apparently are very similar, we wanted to investigate
          the genetic and therapeutic relation of the two. Therefore, the following biological question was
          investigated: "<b>What is the genetic and therapeutic relation between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder?</b>"
          <br>
          <br>On this website you will find a bubble chart with the comorbidities of schizophrenia, a table 
          showing the drug comparison, and three networks: a genetic network of schizophrenia, a genetic network 
          of bipolar disorder and  a genetic network of the bipolar and schizophrenia genes combined. </p>
